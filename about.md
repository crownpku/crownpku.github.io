You found me!


My name is WANG Guan (王冠) and I currently work on some exciting data mining and machine learning projects at [Lenovo Big Data Lab](http://www.onebit.hk/) in Hong Kong. Previously I have worked on machine vision projects at [Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI)](https://www.astri.org/) and system development at [ASM](http://www1.asmpacific.com/en/).


I hold an MPhil degree in Physics from [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](http://www.ust.hk/). My MPhil research work is on [Genetic Algorithms and Complex Network Analysis](http://repository.ust.hk/ir/Record/1783.1-7674). I also hold BSc degree in Physics and Computer Science from [Peking University](http://www.pku.edu.cn/).
